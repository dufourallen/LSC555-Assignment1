	</ul>

	<h1>The Discussion</h1>
	
	<h2>Interesting Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The most interesting feature is the Index of Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web. This index contains a collection of international and multi-lingual exhibitions created by libraries, archives, historical societies, and museums. It currently includes 7,161 exhibition links. There are simple and advanced search engines available. The simple search utilizes keywords and the advanced search utilizes broader browsing options like state/province, country, institutions, and a complete, alphabetized list.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.sil.si.edu/SILPublications/Online-Exhibitions/intro.htm">Index of Library and Archival Exhibitions</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>SIL is a very thorough site.</li>
		<li>There is a refreshing lack of advertising which makes it clean and usable.</li>
		<li>The SIL home page is engaging and pulls the user downwards.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Some pages could use a visual update.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<img class="palette" src="SIL-ColorPalette.png" alt="color palette">	
<ul>
		<li>The visuals for the Index of Library and Archival Exhibitions might benefit from a different color scheme, particularly the khaki background color. Below on the left is the current homepage background color and on the right is the color I would choose from the existing color palette.</li>
